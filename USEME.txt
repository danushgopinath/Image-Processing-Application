RUNNING THE CODE:

1. GUI Application:
   Open the ImageGUI.java file under view package and run it. It should generate the GUI application where you can perform various image operations.
   
   i) Click on Load Image button, and select the edit that you need to work on.
   ii) Select an image operation from the Select Operation drop down list.
   iii) After selecting the desired operation, click on Execute. You should see the changes in the Image Preview Pane and its histogram in the Histogram Pane.
   iv) After applying the desired operations, click on Save Image. Specify the desired location and give the image a name along with its type(jpg, png, ppm).

2. JAR File: 
   Right now the JAR file is present inside the resources folder, but while running it must moved to the root folder i.e. asgn6 and should be run from 
   there. 
   - java -jar .\asgn6.jar : To directly run the JAR file
   - java -jar .\asgn6.jar .\src\script.txt : To load and run the script file
   - java -jar .\asgn6.jar load .\resources\images\beach.jpg beach : To start the interactive mode, load the image first

3. How to Test:
   - To test the ImageController, run the ImageControllerTest.java JUnit4 test class.
   - To test the ImageProcessor, run the Main.java class with the provided script.txt files so that the test images are generated and then run the                       ImageProcessorTest JUnit4 test class.
